<h2>The History of Rugby </h2>
    <p1> In 1820 the game of Rugby was played rather like soccer, but players were allowed to catch the ball and kick it
        out of their hands. There were no limits to the number of players on each side, for example, School House v Rest
        of the School. In 1839, when Queen Adelaide visited the School, School House (75) played "the rest" (225).
        To score a try would not gain points but would allow a team to "try" to take a "drop at goal" to score a point.
        With so many on each side this was hard to do and sometimes games would last up to five days.
        The Close itself was merely three rough fields, and it was not until the late 1850s that the ground was
        levelled.Sheep still grazed here until the early 1900s. There were no written rules at this time.

<h3>The man who changed everything: William Webb Ellis</h3>
        In 1823, William Webb Ellis, a local boy in Town House,<strong><em> first ran with the ball</em></strong>, but this rule was not adopted straight away.
        By 1830, running with the ball was an accepted play, although the first written rules did not appear until 1845.
        These rules were written by the boys. Ellis was born just outside Manchester, but moved down to Rugby.
        He went on to Brasenose College Oxford where he took Holy Orders.
        He died in France in 1872 where his grave is cared for by the French <strong><abbr title="Rugby Football Union">RFU</abbr></strong>.</p1>

<h3>Uniforms, Teams, and Rules</h3>
    <p2>Rugby School was the <strong>only</strong> team to play in white because the committee of the Rugby Football Union in 1871 was composed largely of
        ORs, which is why England played in white. School House was the first team to play in a uniform kit (long
        flannels, shirts and caps), because it was the only House to play as a single group until 1850. Before this, the
        boys played in their ordinary school clothes in teams made up from various Houses.In 1867 the first "foreign"
        match was played against ORs and the town. The teams were now down to 20 players, and then 15 by 1876. Internal
        teams stayed at 20 until 1888. The first inter-School match was against Cheltenham in 1896 and half the players
        in the first England international team were ORs. The RFU was formed (largely of ORs) in 1871 and the first
        national code was introduced. The boys at Rugby kept their own rules, and even modified them, until the late
        1880s. There were no referees in the early days - boys would wear sharpened boots with nails in them for extra
        hacking. Boys considered good enough to play for the main teams were given "following up" caps, which later
        developed into the international cap awarded to the country's top players.</p2>

<h4><strong>Interesting Facts</strong></h4>
<ol>
    <li>The origin of half time originated at the School. After some 40 minutes the School captain stopped the game and
        announced it was hardly fair as his team was playing with a strong following wind. He offered the opposition the
        chance of playing the rest of the match with the breeze. They changed ends and half time was born. Forty minutes
        each way was first mentioned in the 1926 rules.</li>
    <li>The "Kit": England's original white shirt and shorts with black socks is from Rugby and Oxbridge's "blue" is
        directly from the School's XV.</li>
    <li>The terminology in the original rules can still be found in the laws today: knock-on, onside/offside,
        fair catch, try, goal, place kick, 25 yard [22 m.] line, touch judge, charge, scrummage and in-goal.</li>
