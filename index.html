<h2>
    The History of Rugby
</h2>
<p>
    In 1820 the game of Rugby was played rather like soccer, but
    players were allowed to catch the ball and kick it out of
    their hands. There were no limits to the number of players on
    each side, for example, School House v Rest of the School. In
    1839, when Queen Adelaide visited the School, School House
    (75) played "the rest" (225). To score a try would not gain
    points but would allow a team to "try" to take a "drop at
    goal" to score a point. With so many on each side this was
    hard to do and sometimes games would last up to five days.
    The Close itself was merely three rough fields, and it was
    not until the late 1850s that the ground was leveled. Sheep
    still grazed here until the early 1900s. There were no
    written rules at this time.

<h3>
    The man who changed everything: William Webb Ellis
</h3>
<p>
    In 1823, William Webb Ellis, a local boy in Town House,
    <strong><em>first ran with the ball</em></strong>, but this
    rule was not adopted straight away. By 1830, running with the
    ball was an accepted play, although the first written rules
    did not appear until 1845. These rules were written by the
    boys. Ellis was born just outside Manchester, but moved down
    to Rugby. He went on to Brasenose College Oxford where he
    took Holy Orders. He died in France in 1872 where his grave
    is cared for by the French <strong><abbr title=

<h3>
    Uniforms, Teams, and Rules
</h3>
<p>
    Rugby School was the <strong>only</strong> team to play in
    white because the committee of the Rugby Football Union in
    1871 was composed largely of ORs, which is why England played
    in white. School House was the first team to play in a
    uniform kit (long flannels, shirts and caps), because it was
    the only House to play as a single group until 1850. Before
    this, the boys played in their ordinary school clothes in
    teams made up from various Houses.In 1867 the first "foreign"
    match was played against ORs and the town. The teams were now
    down to 20 players, and then 15 by 1876. Internal teams
    stayed at 20 until 1888. The first inter-School match was
    against Cheltenham in 1896 and half the players in the first
    England international team were ORs. The RFU was formed
    (largely of ORs) in 1871 and the first national code was
    introduced. The boys at Rugby kept their own rules, and even
    modified them, until the late 1880s. There were no referees
    in the early days - boys would wear sharpened boots with
    nails in them for extra hacking. Boys considered good enough
    to play for the main teams were given "following up" caps,
    which later developed into the international cap awarded to
    the country's top players.

<h4>
    <strong>Interesting Facts</strong>
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>The origin of half time originated at the School. After
        some 40 minutes the School captain stopped the game and
        announced it was hardly fair as his team was playing with a
        strong following wind. He offered the opposition the chance
        of playing the rest of the match with the breeze. They
        changed ends and half time was born. Forty minutes each way
        was first mentioned in the 1926 rules.
    </li>
    <li>The "Kit": England's original white shirt and shorts with
        black socks is from Rugby and Oxbridge's "blue" is directly
        from the School's XV.
    </li>
    <li>The terminology in the original rules can still be found
        in the laws today: knock-on, onside/offside, fair catch, try,
        goal, place kick, 25 yard [22 m.] line, touch judge, charge,
        scrummage and in-goal.
